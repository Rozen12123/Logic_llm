Task Description: You are given a problem description and a question. The task is to: 
1) define all the predicates in the problem
2) parse the problem into logic rules based on the defined predicates
3) write all the facts mentioned in the problem
4) parse the question into the logic form

**STRICT PREDICATE NAMING RULES**
- Always use a single canonical form (usually singular) for every predicate name.
- Every occurrence of a predicate in `Predicates`, `Facts`, `Rules`, and `Query` MUST use the exact same spelling and casing (e.g., if you define `Tumpus`, you must NEVER write `Tumpuses` or `tumpus` elsewhere).
- When the story uses plural nouns ("Wumpuses"), convert them to the singular predicate name (`Wumpus`) but keep the same canonical form everywhere.
- Do not introduce new predicate names in rules or queries that were not first defined in the `Predicates` section.
- Before outputting, double-check that the predicate in the final `Query` matches one of the defined predicates exactly and that the rules/facts provide a reasoning chain to that predicate.

**FACTS & RULES FORMAT (MANDATORY)**
- Every predicate call MUST take the form `Predicate(Entity, True|False)`; never omit the boolean.
- If the story explicitly states a negative fact ("X is not Y"), write it as `Y(X, False)` in `Facts`.
- Do NOT invent negated predicate names like `NotBright`. Reuse the positive predicate with a boolean flag.
- Rules that conclude negative statements must also use the same predicate with `False` (e.g., `Transparent($x, False)`).

**CRITICAL: Query Format Rules - READ CAREFULLY**
The Query must match the SEMANTIC MEANING of the question statement, NOT what you think the answer is.

**Rule 1: Positive Statements (Affirmative)**
- Question format: "Is X Y?" or "X is Y" or "True or false: X is Y"
- Query format: Y(X, True)
- Examples:
  * "Max is sour" → Query: Sour(Max, True)
  * "Is Stella bright?" → Query: Bright(Stella, True)
  * "True or false: Wren is dull" → Query: Dull(Wren, True)

**Rule 2: Negative Statements (Negation)**
- Question format: "Is X not Y?" or "X is not Y" or "True or false: X is not Y"
- Query format: Y(X, False)
- Examples:
  * "Alex is not shy" → Query: Shy(Alex, False)
  * "Is Wren not metallic?" → Query: Metallic(Wren, False)
  * "True or false: Alex is not dull" → Query: Dull(Alex, False)

**IMPORTANT:**
- The boolean value (True/False) in the Query represents what the question is ASKING to verify
- If the question says "X is Y", you are checking if X IS Y, so use True
- If the question says "X is not Y", you are checking if X IS NOT Y, so use False
- DO NOT confuse the query format with the expected answer - the query format is determined by the question statement itself

**IMPORTANT OUTPUT FORMAT:**
- Output ONLY the following format, without any explanations, markdown formatting, or step-by-step breakdowns
- Start directly with "Predicates:" followed by the predicate definitions
- Then "Facts:" followed by the facts
- Then "Rules:" followed by the rules
- Finally "Query:" followed by the query
- Do NOT include any introductory text, explanations, or markdown formatting (no **, *, ---, etc.)

Problem:
Each jompus is fruity. Every jompus is a wumpus. Every wumpus is not transparent. Wumpuses are tumpuses. Tumpuses are mean. Tumpuses are vumpuses. Every vumpus is cold. Each vumpus is a yumpus. Yumpuses are orange. Yumpuses are numpuses. Numpuses are dull. Each numpus is a dumpus. Every dumpus is not shy. Impuses are shy. Dumpuses are rompuses. Each rompus is liquid. Rompuses are zumpuses. Alex is a tumpus.
Question:
True or false: Alex is not shy.
